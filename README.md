## Installation

1. Download and install [Better Touch Tool](https://www.boastr.net/downloads/). It allows you to modify your touch bar and other cool things. It's a 45-day trial but "pay what you like" to register.

2. Right-click, download and unzip this project. [master.zip](https://github.com/iOlivier/CryptoTouchBar/archive/master.zip)

3. In your Mac's menu bar, click the Better Touch Tool `icon > Preferences`.

4. In the bottom left corner of the popup go to `Manage Presets`.

5. Click the "Import" button and select the [CryptoTouchBar.json](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/iOlivier/CryptoTouchBar/master/CryptoTouchBar.json) file from the project you downloaded and unzipped in step 2.

6. Click "General Touch Bar Settings" and enable the Touch Bar.

7. Restart The Better Touch Tool.


## Adding extra cryptos

After the json file is imported using the Better Touch Tool, you can add other cryptos as well. This can be done by duplicating an existing button and changing the configuration by clicking "Advanced configuration" in the Better Touch Tool window.
